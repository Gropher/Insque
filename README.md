# Insque

Instant queue. Background processing and message driven communication tool. Faster and simplier alternative to Resque.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'insque'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it manually:

    $ gem install insque

## Usage

At first you need to generate initializer and redis config file. Pass your sender name as parameter. 
Sender name is the unique identifier of your instance of insque. You can use several instances of insque to create message driven communication system. 

    $ rails g insque:initializer somesender

### Sending

To broadcast message use:
```ruby
Insque.broadcast :message_name, {:params => {:some => :params}}
```
There is an easy way to use insque as background jobs processing. You can use `send_later` method to call any method of your rails models in background:
```ruby
@model = MyModel.first
@model.send_later :mymethod, 'some', 'params'
```
You'll need a special slow listener running to make this work.
```ruby
Insque.slow_listen
```
there is a matching slow janitor as well:
```ruby
Insque.slow_janitor
```

### Recieving

To start recieving messages you need to:

1. Create handler method in Insque module. First part of handler name is the name of the message sender.
    ```ruby
    def somesender_message_name message
      #TODO: Handle message somehow
    end
    ```

2. Call `listen` method in some background process or rake task:
    ```ruby
    Insque.listen
    ```

   or just run `bundle exec rake insque:listener` from your console.

3. Call `janitor` method in some background process or rake task. Janitor will reissue failed messages or report error if message fails again. Janitor treats message as failed if it was not processed for an hour after broadcast or reissue.
    ```ruby
    Insque.janitor
    ```

   or just run `bundle exec rake insque:janitor` from your console.

### Run All At Once

There is a simple way to run all insque workers, both regular and slow in a single multi-threaded process:
```ruby
bundle exec rake insque:run
```

### Redis Cluster Support

To make insque run on Redis Cluster add this line to your application's `Gemfile`:

    gem 'redis_cluster'
    
and change `redis.yml` file accordingly:

    production:
    - host: cluster_host1
      port: 1234
    - host: cluster_host2
      port: 1234
    - host: cluster_host3
      port: 1234

### Daemonizing

If you want to run insque as a daemon consider using [foreman](https://github.com/ddollar/foreman) for this. 

If you deploy with capistrano you may want to try a version of foreman with build in capistrano support.

Add foreman to your `Gemfile`:

    gem 'foreman' # OR
    gem 'foreman-capistrano'

Install it:

    $ bundle install  

Create `Procfile`:

    insque: bundle exec rake insque:run


Run foreman from your console:
    
    $ bundle exec foreman start

For production use modify your capistrano deploy script somewhat like this:
    
    set :default_environment, {'PATH' => "/sbin:$PATH"}  # Optional. Useful if you get errors because start or restart command not found
    set :foreman_concurrency, "\"insque=1\"" # How many processes of each type do you want
    require 'foreman/capistrano'
    
    after "deploy", "foreman:export"  # Export Procfile as a set of upstart jobs
    after "deploy", "foreman:restart" # You will need upstart installed on your server for this to work.
